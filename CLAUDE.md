## Architecture

For a comprehensive overview of the complete project structure, file organization, and package relationships, see [`docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

**IMPORTANT**: When making structural changes to the project (adding/removing packages, applications, or reorganizing directories), always update `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to reflect the changes. This ensures the documentation stays current and accurate for all developers.

### Monorepo Structure

- Uses **pnpm workspaces** for dependency management
- **TypeScript project references** for coordinated builds and type checking
- **Shared packages** with workspace protocol dependencies (`workspace:*`)
- **Firebase** (`firebase.json`) configures Cloud Functions, Firestore, and emulators
- **Design system** ensures brand consistency across web and mobile

### Key Components

**Smart Contract Layer:**

- `PoolFactory` - Deploys lending pools (controlled by multi-sig Safe)
- `LendingPool` - Individual pool contracts with membership and lending logic
- Upgradeable proxies pattern for contract updates

**Backend Services:**

### Development Flow

#### Hybrid Testing Strategy (Recommended)

**Fast Local Development** (Core Contract Logic):

1. **Local Blockchain**: Start with `pnpm node:local` for instant development
2. **Core Testing**: Use `pnpm test:local` for fast contract logic validation
3. **Basic Ownership**: Test 2-step ownership transfer with regular addresses
4. **Emergency Functions**: Test pause/unpause and basic admin functions
5. **Mobile Testing**: Connect to localhost network for immediate testing

**Comprehensive Safe Integration** (Multi-Sig Testing):

1. **Forked Network**: Use `pnpm node:fork` for realistic network conditions
2. **Safe Testing**: Use `pnpm test:safe` for complete multi-sig workflow
3. **Real Safe Contracts**: Test with actual Safe SDK and contracts
4. **Multi-Sig Simulation**: Full signature collection and execution process
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Test emergency functions through Safe multi-sig

**Combined Testing**:

```bash
# Test everything (local + Safe integration)
pnpm test:full

# Individual test scenarios
pnpm test:local    # Fast core contract testing
pnpm test:safe     # Complete Safe multi-sig testing
```

**Benefits of Hybrid Approach**:

- ✅ **Fast Iteration**: Local testing for rapid development cycles
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Full Safe integration testing
- ✅ **Realistic Conditions**: Forked network mirrors production environment
- ✅ **Emergency Procedures**: Multi-sig approval simulation for critical functions

#### Production Deployment

1. Smart contracts deployed to Polygon Amoy testnet
2. Backend Cloud Functions handle off-chain logic and Safe interactions
3. Mobile app connects wallets and interfaces with both backend and contracts
4. Device approval happens automatically after successful wallet authentication
5. All admin actions (pool creation, member approval, loan decisions) go through multi-sig Safe

### Security Architecture

**Device Verification Flow:**

1. User attempts to access Firebase services (App Check token required)
2. If device not approved → authentication required
3. User authenticates with wallet signature
4. Upon successful wallet auth → device automatically approved
5. Future App Check tokens issued for approved devices only

**Collections:**

- `approved_devices` - Stores device-to-wallet mappings with approval timestamps
- `auth_nonces` - Time-limited nonces for wallet authentication (10 min expiry)
- `users` - User profiles linked to wallet addresses

## Environment Setup

**Critical Security Notes:**

- Never commit `.env` files or service account keys
- Use testnet keys only for development
- All production secrets managed via Firebase Functions config

**Required Environment Files:**

- `packages/contracts/.env` - Deployment keys, RPC URLs, Etherscan API key
- `packages/backend/.env` - Firebase config, contract addresses
- `apps/mobile/.env` - Public Firebase config, contract addresses
- `packages/backend/service-account-key.json` - Firebase Admin SDK (gitignored)

**API Keys and Contract Verification:**

- Get a single **Etherscan API key** from https://etherscan.io/apis (not Polygonscan)
- This unified API key works across all supported chains including Polygon (chain ID 137)
- Use `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in contracts/.env for Hardhat verification
- Etherscan API v2 provides multichain access - no separate Polygonscan key needed
- V1 API will be disabled after May 31, 2025 - all new integrations use v2

**Safe Multi-Sig Configuration:**

- `SAFE_OWNERS` - Comma-separated owner addresses (e.g., `0xAddr1,0xAddr2,0xAddr3`)
- `SAFE_THRESHOLD` - Required signatures (recommended: 2+ for testnet, 3+ for mainnet)
- `SAFE_SALT_NONCE` - Optional deterministic deployment nonce

## Development Workflow

### Local Smart Contract Development

#### Option 1: Pure Local Development (Fastest)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local Hardhat node
cd packages/contracts
pnpm node:local

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts to localhost
pnpm deploy:local

# Terminal 3: Interactive testing
pnpm console:local
```

#### Option 2: Forked Network Development (Most Realistic)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start forked node (requires POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL in .env)
cd packages/contracts
pnpm node:fork

# Terminal 2: Deploy to forked network
pnpm deploy:fork

# Terminal 3: Test against real network state
pnpm test:fork
```

#### Mobile App Integration with Local Network

The mobile app automatically includes localhost (chain ID 31337) in development mode:

- Network appears in wallet connection UI when `__DEV__` is true
- Connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8545` to interact with local contracts
- Deploy contracts locally first, then update mobile app with contract addresses
- Instant testing without testnet POL or network delays
- Full control over blockchain state for comprehensive testing scenarios

#### Advanced Local Development Features

- **Test Utilities**: Use `scripts/test-utils.ts` for comprehensive testing helpers
- **Pre-funded Accounts**: 10 accounts with defined roles (deployer, pool owners, borrowers, lenders)
- **Sample Data**: 3 pools automatically created with different configurations
- **Interactive Guide**: Complete `INTERACTION_GUIDE.md` with examples for all interaction methods

### Testing Backend Functions

1. Generate development keys: `pnpm generateKey`
2. Get auth message from `generateAuthMessage` function
3. Sign with `pnpm signMessage <nonce> <timestamp>`
4. Test authentication with `verifySignatureAndLogin`

### Firebase Emulator Setup

```bash
cd packages/backend
pnpm serve  # Starts auth:9099, functions:5001, firestore:8080
```

### Safe Multi-Sig Testing Strategy

SuperPool uses a **hybrid testing approach** for Safe multi-signature wallet integration:

#### Local Development (Recommended for Daily Work)

```bash
pnpm test:local        # Fast contract testing without Safe dependency
pnpm demo:safe         # Educational Safe workflow demonstration
pnpm deploy:local      # Local deployment for frontend integration
```

**Benefits:**

- Instant feedback loop for development
- Tests all core contract functionality
- No external dependencies or rate limits
- Perfect for CI/CD and unit testing

#### Safe Integration (Production Validation)

```bash
pnpm safe:deploy:amoy  # Deploy Safe wallet on testnet
pnpm transfer:ownership:amoy  # Transfer PoolFactory ownership to Safe
```

**Use Cases:**

- Final production validation
- Multi-sig workflow testing
- Security model verification
- Testnet/mainnet deployment

#### Documentation

- See `packages/contracts/docs/HYBRID_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for complete details
- Local testing covers 95% of development needs
- Safe integration reserved for production-critical validation

### Contract Development Best Practices

- **Local Testing**: Use `pnpm test:local` for fast development iteration
- **Safe Demo**: Use `pnpm demo:safe` to understand multi-sig workflow
- **Integration Testing**: Use forked networks when stable RPC access available
- **Mobile Testing**: Deploy locally with `pnpm deploy:local` for frontend integration
- **Pre-Production**: Deploy to Polygon Amoy with `pnpm deploy:amoy`
- **Verification**: Use Etherscan API v2 (supports Polygon chain ID 137)
- **Security**: Transfer ownership to multi-sig Safe post-deployment

## Git & Version Control

Add and commit automatically whenever an entire task is finished
Use descriptive commit messages that capture the full scope of changes
Follow this pattern for all commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types:**

- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Scopes:**

- `backend` - Backend/Cloud Functions changes
- `mobile` - Mobile app changes
- `contracts` - Smart contract changes
- `multi` - Changes affecting multiple packages
- `config` - Configuration changes

**Examples:**

```
feat(mobile): implement wallet connection with Reown AppKit
fix(backend): add nonce expiration to prevent authentication replay attacks
test(backend): add unit tests for all backend functions
refactor(contracts): reorganize contract structure for upgradability
```

## Multi-Sig Administration

Critical protocol actions require multi-sig approval:

- Pool creation via `PoolFactory`
- Pool parameter updates
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- All admin-level decisions go through Safe contracts for enhanced security

## Code Examples & Documentation

When users request code examples, setup instructions, configuration steps, or library/API documentation, use the **Ref MCP Server** to provide up-to-date, accurate information from official sources rather than potentially outdated examples.

## Sprint Planning & Feature Development

For sprint planning, feature prioritization, and development roadmap tasks, refer to [`docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`](docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md).

## UI & Frontend Interface Design

For UI & frontend interface design tasks, refer to the comprehensive guidelines in [`docs/SUPERDESIGN.md`](docs/SUPERDESIGN.md).

## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Code Quality Checks

**ALWAYS run the following commands before completing any task:**

1. Automatically use the IDE's built-in diagnostics tool to check for linting and type errors:
   - Run `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` to check all files for diagnostics
   - Fix any linting or type errors before considering the task complete
   - Do this for any file you create or modify

This is a CRITICAL step that must NEVER be skipped when working on any code-related task.
