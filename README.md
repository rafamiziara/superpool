## üåü Project Overview

**SuperPool** is a proof-of-concept decentralized micro-lending platform built on the **Polygon (PoS)** network. It aims to showcase a community-driven lending model where users can create and manage their own lending "pools," contribute liquidity, and request loans within a trusted environment.

This project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating expertise across blockchain smart contract development, modern mobile application development (React Native), and robust backend cloud infrastructure (Firebase Cloud Functions).

### Key Features:

- **Multi-Pool Architecture:** Supports the creation of multiple independent lending pools, each with its own members and potentially unique parameters.
- **Permissioned Membership:** Pool administrators (initially controlled by a multi-sig Safe) approve members before they can contribute or borrow.
- **Liquidity Contribution:** Pool members can contribute MATIC (or a custom ERC-20 token) to provide liquidity for loans.
- **Loan Request & Approval:** Members can request loans from their pool. Loan requests are initially reviewed by an off-chain AI agent (mocked/basic implementation) and then approved by the pool admin.
- **Loan Repayment & Management:** Borrowers can repay loans. Admins can manage defaults.
- **Multi-Sig Administration:** Core protocol contracts (like the Pool Factory) are controlled by a [e.g., 2-of-3] multi-signature Safe for enhanced security and progressive decentralization. Individual pools are managed by their respective admin.
- **Monorepo Structure:** A streamlined development environment encompassing all project components in a single repository.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Smart Contracts:** Deployed on Polygon, managing core lending logic, liquidity, and membership. The `PoolFactory` is controlled by a multi-sig Safe, which deploys upgradable `LendingPool` instances.
2.  **Backend (Cloud Functions):** Acts as a bridge between the mobile app and smart contracts. It handles user authentication, stores off-chain data, processes loan assessment requests (AI agent), sends notifications, and interacts with smart contracts for specific admin-controlled actions (via multi-sig).
3.  **Mobile App:** Provides the user interface for interacting with the platform, connecting wallets, initiating transactions, and viewing data fetched from the backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the SuperPool project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (install via `npm install -g pnpm`)
- Git
- A Polygon (Amoy Testnet recommended) wallet with some MATIC for gas.
- A Firebase project set up with Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Functions enabled.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafamiziara/superpool.git
cd superpool
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables (Crucial!)

**NEVER commit your `.env` files or any sensitive information to Git.**

Create `.env` files in the following locations and populate them with your credentials. **These files are already in** `.gitignore`.

- `packages/contracts/.env`

```
# For deploying contracts (use a testnet key!)
PRIVATE_KEY=[YOUR_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY]

# Polygon Amoy RPC URL (e.g., Alchemy, Infura)
POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/[YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY]
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=[YOUR_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY] # For contract verification
```

- `packages/backend/.env`

```
# For Firebase Admin SDK if needed, or other backend-specific secrets
# Typically, Firebase Admin SDK works via service account files,
# or you'll use Firebase Functions environment config directly.

# For local functions emulator:
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/firebase-adminsdk.json

# Or for other APIs your Cloud Functions might call
AI_API_KEY=[YOUR_AI_SERVICE_API_KEY]

# Contract addresses deployed to Amoy
POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS=[DEPLOYED_POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS_ON_AMOY]
```

_Note: For actual Firebase Functions deployment, you should use `firebase functions:config:set` for secrets, not `.env`._

- `packages/mobile-app/.env`

```
# Public Firebase config (safe to be here, but still use .env for consistency)
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...

# Cloud Functions Base URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL=https://[YOUR_REGION]-[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/api

# Contract addresses deployed to Amoy
EXPO_PUBLIC_POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS=[DEPLOYED_POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS_ON_AMOY]
```

### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts (Testnet)

Navigate to the `contracts` package and deploy:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm deploy:amoy # This command should be defined in your package.json scripts
```

- **Important:** Note the deployed `PoolFactory` address. You will need this for your `backend` and `mobile-app` `.env` files.

- **Multi-sig Setup:** After `PoolFactory` is deployed, set up your multi-sig Safe (e.g., Gnosis Safe on Polygon Amoy) and transfer ownership of the `PoolFactory` to your Safe. All subsequent calls to `createPool` from your backend should be initiated via the Safe.

### 5. Deploy Backend Cloud Functions

Navigate to the `backend` package and deploy your Firebase Functions:

```bash
cd packages/backend

# Set Firebase project if you haven't already
firebase use [YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID]

# Set config variables (e.g., contract addresses, any private API keys)
firebase functions:config:set contracts.pool_factory_address="[DEPLOYED_POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS_ON_AMOY]" ai.api_key="[YOUR_AI_SERVICE_API_KEY]"

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only functions
```

- **Important:** Note the base URL for your deployed Cloud Functions. Update `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL` in `packages/mobile-app/.env`.

### 6. Run the Mobile Application

Navigate to the `mobile-app` package and start the Expo development server:

```bash
cd packages/mobile-app
pnpm start
```

- This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with your phone (using the Expo Go app) or run it on an Android/iOS simulator.

## ü§ù Multi-Sig Administration

This project utilizes a multi-signature wallet (Safe) to control critical protocol-level actions, such as deploying new `LendingPool` contract versions via the `PoolFactory`. This demonstrates enhanced security and a step towards decentralized governance.

To interact with actions requiring multi-sig approval (e.g., initiating a `createPool` call via the backend), the transaction will be proposed on your Safe. The configured owners will then need to confirm the transaction via the Safe web or mobile app.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

**This project is a personal portfolio piece and proof-of-concept. It is NOT intended for production use without comprehensive security audits, bug bounties, and significant hardening.**

- **Unaudited Contracts:** The smart contracts in this repository have **NOT been formally audited by a professional security firm.** They may contain vulnerabilities.
- **No Guarantees:** There are no guarantees of security, correctness, or functionality for real-world financial transactions.
- **Use at Your Own Risk:** Any interaction with the deployed smart contracts on any network (testnet or mainnet) is done at your own risk.
- **Testnet Keys Only:** Always use dedicated testnet private keys for development and testing. **NEVER use your mainnet private keys or seed phrases with this codebase.**
- **AI Agent:** The AI loan assessment component is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes and does not replace robust financial risk assessment.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap: Beyond the MVP

Our current MVP for SuperPool focuses on establishing core decentralized micro-lending functionalities. However, we envision a robust platform with advanced features for enhanced user experience, security, and decentralized governance.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what's next for SuperPool:

### Lending & Liquidity Enhancements

- **Loan Collateral Management:** Enable loans to be secured by on-chain collateral (e.g., ERC-20 tokens), with mechanisms for deposit, withdrawal, and liquidation.
- **Flexible Repayment Schedules:** Allow for partial loan repayments and customizable repayment frequencies (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- **Dynamic Interest Rates:** Implement interest rates that adjust based on pool utilization, supply/demand, or external market data via oracles.

### Community & Governance

- **DAO Integration:** Transition protocol-level decisions (e.g., new pool parameters, fee structure) to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by token holders.
- **Community Feedback & Reporting:** Allow users to report issues or provide feedback on pool members, contributing to reputation.

### Security & Operations

- **Decentralized Liquidation:** Explore automated, decentralized liquidation processes using Chainlink Automation (Keepers) instead of relying solely on admin intervention.
- **Insurance Fund:** Implement a mechanism to collect a small portion of loan interest into an insurance fund to cover potential defaults.
