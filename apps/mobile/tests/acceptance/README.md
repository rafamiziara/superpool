# Acceptance Tests

This directory contains tests that validate business requirements and user acceptance criteria.

## Test Categories

- **Business Logic Validation**: Verify core business rules are enforced
- **User Story Tests**: Test acceptance criteria from user stories
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance requirements are met
- **Feature Completeness**: Validate all feature requirements

## Guidelines

- Write tests in business language (Given-When-Then format)
- Focus on user value and business outcomes
- Test business rules and constraints
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

## Example Test Structure

```typescript
// authentication.test.ts
describe('Authentication Business Requirements', () => {
  it('should enforce wallet signature requirements per security policy', async () => {
    // Given a user attempts authentication
    // When they provide an invalid signature
    // Then the system should reject the attempt
  })
})
```
