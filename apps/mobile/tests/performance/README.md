# Performance Tests

This directory contains tests focused on performance benchmarks and optimization validation.

## Test Categories

- **MobX Store Performance**: Measure store update times and reaction efficiency
- **Component Render Performance**: Test component mounting and update performance
- **Memory Usage Tests**: Monitor memory consumption patterns
- **Network Performance**: Test API call efficiency and caching

## Guidelines

- Use performance measurement utilities (React DevTools Profiler, etc.)
- Set performance budgets and thresholds
- Test both initial load and ongoing usage patterns
- Include tests for memory leaks and cleanup

## Example Test Structure

```typescript
// store-updates.test.ts
describe('MobX Store Performance', () => {
  it('should update authentication store within performance budget', async () => {
    // Measure store update performance
  })
})
```
