## 🚀 SuperPool Features

The feature illustrations represent SuperPool's core capabilities:

### 1. 🔐 Secure Wallet Authentication (`feature_1.png`)

Connect with 100+ wallets including MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase. Secure signature-based login with no passwords required.

### 2. 🏊 Create & Join Lending Pools (`feature_2.png`)

Start your own micro-lending community or join existing pools. Each pool has its own members and lending parameters managed by administrators.

### 3. 💰 Contribute & Borrow Funds (`feature_3.png`)

Pool members can contribute POL to provide liquidity and request loans from their trusted community with AI-assisted approval.

### 4. 🛡️ Multi-Sig Security (`feature_4.png`)

Enhanced security through multi-signature wallet controls for all critical protocol actions, ensuring decentralized governance and protection.

## 🚀 Usage

### React Native (Mobile App)

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native'
import { illustrations } from '@superpool/assets'

// Use exported illustrations object
<Image source={illustrations.walletAuth} />

// Or import directly
const featureImage = require('@superpool/assets/images/illustrations/feature_1.png')
<Image source={featureImage} />
```

### Next.js (Landing Page)

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image'
import { imagePaths } from '@superpool/assets'

// Use exported image paths (recommended)
<Image src={imagePaths.illustrations.walletAuth} alt="Secure Wallet Authentication" />
