# Emergency Procedures Quick Reference

## üö® Critical Emergency Response

### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)

1. **Emergency Pause** (if security threat detected)

   ```bash
   # Through Safe multi-sig - requires threshold signatures
   safe-cli tx <SAFE_ADDRESS> <POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS> "emergencyPause()"
   ```

2. **Alert Team**

   - Notify all Safe signers immediately
   - Post in emergency Slack/Discord channel
   - Document the incident

3. **Assess Situation**
   - Identify threat type and scope
   - Determine if pause is sufficient
   - Check for ongoing attacks

### Emergency Contacts

| Role       | Primary            | Secondary                    |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Tech Lead  | Slack: @techlead   | Phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX       |
| Security   | Discord: @security | Email: security@superpool.io |
| Operations | Slack: @ops        | SMS Alert System             |

## üîß Common Emergency Scenarios

### 1. Security Vulnerability Discovered

**Immediate Response:**

```bash
# 1. Emergency pause
pnpm transfer:ownership:amoy complete <FACTORY> <SAFE> "emergencyPause()"

# 2. Verify pause status
pnpm transfer:ownership verify <FACTORY_ADDRESS>
```

**Follow-up:**

- Coordinate with security team
- Assess vulnerability scope
- Plan remediation strategy
- Prepare fix and testing

### 2. Safe Signer Compromise

**If threshold still achievable:**

```bash
# Continue operations with remaining signers
# Plan Safe configuration update to remove compromised signer
```

**If threshold not achievable:**

- **CRITICAL**: Contact all remaining signers immediately
- Consider emergency governance procedures
- May require contract migration

### 3. Failed Ownership Transfer

**Symptoms:**

- Transfer stuck in pending state
- Safe cannot accept ownership

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Check status
pnpm transfer:ownership verify <FACTORY> <SAFE>

# Reset transfer if needed
pnpm transfer:ownership:amoy initiate <FACTORY> <SAFE>
```

### 4. Contract Upgrade Failure

**If upgrade transaction reverts:**

1. Verify upgrade implementation is correct
2. Check Safe has sufficient gas
3. Ensure all signatures collected
4. Retry with higher gas limit

**If upgrade causes issues:**

1. Emergency pause if needed
2. Assess impact scope
3. Plan rollback strategy
4. Test fix on testnet first

## üîç Diagnostic Commands

### Check System Status

```bash
# Ownership status
pnpm transfer:ownership verify <FACTORY_ADDRESS>

# Contract state
npx hardhat console --network <NETWORK>
# Then: const factory = await ethers.getContractAt('PoolFactory', '<ADDRESS>')
# factory.paused(), factory.owner(), factory.getPoolCount()
```

### Verify Safe Configuration

```bash
# Using Safe CLI
safe-cli safe-info <SAFE_ADDRESS>

# Check owners and threshold
safe-cli owners <SAFE_ADDRESS>
```

## üìû Escalation Matrix

### Severity Levels

**CRITICAL** (System compromised, funds at risk)

- Response time: < 15 minutes
- All hands on deck
- Emergency pause immediately
- C-level notification

**HIGH** (Functionality impaired, no immediate fund risk)

- Response time: < 1 hour
- Technical team response
- Assess need for pause
- Management notification

**MEDIUM** (Degraded service, workarounds available)

- Response time: < 4 hours
- Planned maintenance window
- User communication
- Normal escalation

**LOW** (Minor issues, full functionality maintained)

- Response time: < 24 hours
- Regular support queue
- Documentation update
- Monitor for patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Recovery Procedures

### After Emergency Pause

1. **Investigation Complete**

   - Verify threat eliminated
   - Test fixes on testnet
   - Prepare recovery plan

2. **Gradual Recovery**

   ```bash
   # Unpause system
   safe-cli tx <SAFE_ADDRESS> <POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS> "emergencyUnpause()"

   # Monitor closely
   # Watch for any anomalies
   # Be ready to pause again if needed
   ```

3. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures
   - Conduct team retrospective
   - Improve monitoring/alerts

### Rollback Procedures

**If contract upgrade causes issues:**

1. **Immediate**

   ```bash
   # Emergency pause
   safe-cli tx <SAFE_ADDRESS> <POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS> "emergencyPause()"
   ```

2. **Assessment**

   - Determine if rollback needed
   - Check if previous version is safe
   - Prepare rollback implementation

3. **Rollback Execution**
   ```bash
   # Deploy previous implementation
   # Prepare upgrade transaction back to previous version
   # Execute through Safe multi-sig
   # Test functionality
   # Unpause when confirmed working
   ```
