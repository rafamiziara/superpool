  // Get signers (these would be the Safe owners in production)

  console.log('📋 Safe Configuration:')

  console.log('🏗️  Step 1: Deploy PoolFactory with Safe as Owner')
  console.log('In production, the PoolFactory would be deployed and ownership transferred to the Safe wallet')
  console.log()

  console.log('🔄 Step 2: Multi-Sig Transaction Process')
  console.log("When admin actions are needed (like creating a pool), here's the workflow:")
  console.log()

  console.log('   🎯 Transaction Initiation:')
  console.log('   - Any Safe owner proposes a transaction (e.g., create new lending pool)')
  console.log('   - Transaction details: target contract, function call, parameters')
  console.log('   - Transaction is submitted to Safe for approval')
  console.log()

  console.log('   ✍️  Signature Collection:')
  console.log('   - Owner 1 signs the transaction hash')
  console.log('   - Owner 2 reviews and signs the transaction hash')
  console.log('   - Threshold reached (2 of 3 signatures collected)')
  console.log()

  console.log('   ⚡ Transaction Execution:')
  console.log('   - Any owner can execute the transaction once threshold is met')
  console.log('   - Safe validates all signatures before execution')
  console.log('   - Transaction is executed against the target contract')
  console.log()

  console.log('🔒 Step 3: Security Benefits')
  console.log('- No single point of failure - requires multiple approvals')
  console.log('- Transparent process - all transactions are visible on-chain')
  console.log('- Atomic execution - transaction either fully succeeds or fails')
  console.log('- Configurable threshold - can be adjusted based on security needs')
  console.log()

  console.log('📝 Example: Creating a New Lending Pool')
  console.log('Transaction data that would be signed:')

  // Simulate the transaction data that would be created for Safe
  const poolCreationData = {
    to: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // PoolFactory address
    value: 0,
    data: '0x12345678', // Encoded function call to createPool()
    operation: 0, // Call operation
    safeTxGas: 100000,
    baseGas: 21000,
    gasPrice: ethers.parseUnits('20', 'gwei'),
    gasToken: ethers.ZeroAddress,
    refundReceiver: ethers.ZeroAddress,
    nonce: 1,
  }

  console.log('  Target Contract:', poolCreationData.to)
  console.log('  Function Call:', poolCreationData.data)
  console.log('  Gas Limit:', poolCreationData.safeTxGas)
  console.log('  Nonce:', poolCreationData.nonce)
  console.log()

  console.log('🔍 Step 4: Transaction Hash Generation')
  console.log('Safe generates a unique hash for this transaction:')

  // This would be generated by Safe SDK in production
  const mockTransactionHash = ethers.keccak256(
    ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(
      ['address', 'uint256', 'bytes', 'uint8'],
      [poolCreationData.to, poolCreationData.value, poolCreationData.data, poolCreationData.operation]
    )
  )

  console.log('Transaction Hash:', mockTransactionHash)
  console.log()

  console.log('✅ Step 5: Owner Signatures')
  console.log('Each owner signs this hash off-chain:')

  // Simulate signatures (in production, these would be real signatures)
  const message = ethers.getBytes(mockTransactionHash)

  try {
    const signature1 = await deployer.signMessage(message)
    const signature2 = await owner1.signMessage(message)

    console.log('Owner 1 Signature:', signature1.slice(0, 20) + '...')
    console.log('Owner 2 Signature:', signature2.slice(0, 20) + '...')
    console.log('✅ Threshold reached! Transaction ready for execution')
  } catch {
    console.log('Signature demonstration (mock signatures generated)')
    console.log('✅ Threshold reached! Transaction ready for execution')
  }
  console.log()

  console.log('🚀 Step 6: Execution')
  console.log('Any Safe owner can now execute the transaction:')
  console.log('- Safe validates all signatures are from valid owners')
  console.log("- Safe checks transaction hasn't been executed before")
  console.log('- Safe executes the transaction against PoolFactory')
  console.log('- New lending pool is created!')
  console.log()

  console.log('🎉 Complete Multi-Sig Workflow Demonstrated!')
  console.log()
  console.log('💡 Key Points:')
  console.log('- Local testing: Use our fast local flow for development')
  console.log('- Production: Deploy Safe wallet and transfer PoolFactory ownership')
  console.log('- All admin actions go through multi-sig approval process')
  console.log('- Enhanced security through distributed control')
  console.log()
  console.log('🔗 Next Steps:')
  console.log('1. Deploy PoolFactory to testnet/mainnet')
  console.log('2. Deploy Safe wallet with appropriate owners and threshold')
  console.log('3. Transfer PoolFactory ownership to Safe')
  console.log('4. Use Safe UI or SDK for transaction management')
